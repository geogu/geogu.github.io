<h3>1. Cramming for success: study and academic work</h3>
<p>
Before an exam, some students <a>cram for</a> it. Even if you're a <a>genius</a>, you'll have to <a>do some revision</a>. If the exam happens every year, you can revise by looking at <a>past papers</a>. Some things can be <a>memorised</a> or <a>learnt (off) by heart</a>. But <a>rote-learning</a> is not sufficient for most subjects. It is also possible to use <a>mnemonics</a>. However, all things considered, the best idea is to <a>bury yourself in your books</a> and to study <a>intensively</a> until you <a>know the subject inside out</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a>composition</a> could be just 50–100 words, often used for school work.
<a>essay</a> longer than a composition, more serious, hundreds or thousands of words.
<a>assignment</a> a long essay, often part of a course, usually thousands of words.
<a>project</a> like an assignment, but <a>emphasis on</a> student's own material and topic.
<a>portfolio</a> a collection of <a>individual pieces of work</a>; may include drawings and other examples of creative work as well as writing.
<a>dissertation</a> a long, <a>research-based</a> work, perhaps 10–15,000 words, for a <a>degree or diploma</a>.
<a>thesis</a> a very long, <a>original</a>, <a>research-based</a> work, perhaps 80–100,000 words, for a higher degree (e.g. PhD).

It's a good idea to start with a mind map1 when preparing an essay. Always write a first draft 2 before writing up the final version. Your essay should be all your own work; plagiarism3 is a very serious off ence in colleges and universities. It is an increasing problem because it is so easy to cut and paste from materials available on the internet, and students have to sign a plagiarism form to say that the work they are handing in is all their own and that they acknowledge4 any sources they have used. There is usually a deadline5 . Aft er the essay is submitted6 , it will be assessed7 and usually you can get feedback8 .
