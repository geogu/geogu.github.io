<h2>4. Job interviews</h2>
<h3>Preparing for interviews</h3>
<p>
When companies are <a>recruiting</a> , they often have <a>a set of criteria</a> (e.g. three years of <a>experience in the field</a>, or a degree in a relevant area) which they use to find the most <a>suitable</a> candidates. If you are <a>shortlisted for</a> an interview, make sure you <a>do your homework</a> first: find out as much as you can about the company, its products, markets, competitors, etc. If you can, ask a friend to <a>do a trial run</a> with you. This will help <a>boost your confidence</a>. The interview may be <a>conducted by a panel</a>, probably including your future <a>line manager</a>. Don't forget to <a>make eye contact</a> with all the interviewers while you are talking. As you arrive for the interview, <a>body language</a> is important. Give <a>a firm handshake</a> and <a>speak up</a>. This will help to <a>create a good first impression</a>.
</p>

<h2>2. Education: debates and issues</h2>
<h3>Opportunity and equality</h3>
<p>
All education systems may ultimately be judged in terms of <a>equality of opportunity</a>. This is often <a>referred to</a> in the debates over <a>selective versus comprehensive schooling</a>. The main issue is whether everyone has the same opportunities for educational achievement or whether <a>elitism</a> of one sort or another is <a>inherent in</a> the system.
</p>
<p>
<a>League tables</a> for schools and colleges may actually help unintentionally to <a>perpetuate</a> inequalities, while claiming to promote <a>the raising of standards</a>. Inevitably, league tables divide educational institutions into good and bad, success and failure, resulting in <a>a two-tier system</a>, or at least that is how the public <a>perceives</a> it. The ability of <a>better-off</a> parents and <a>wellendowed</a> schools to push children towards the institutions at the top of the league may, in the long term, have the effect of <a>depressing</a> opportunity for the <a>less well-off</a> or for children from home environments that do not provide the push and motivation to <a>excel</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a>Financial support</a> of different kinds can help to make educational opportunity more equal. There are, for example, <a>scholarships</a> or <a>bursaries</a> that make it possible for less privileged youngsters to afford <a>tertiary education</a>. <a>Student loans</a> allow <a>undergraduates</a> to pay for their <a>tuition fees</a> and <a>living expenses</a> while they are studying. But few would claim that real equality of opportunity has been achieved.
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other debates and issues</h3>
<p>
Some people think we should return to <a>an emphasis on the three Rs</a>, the traditional, basic skills. [<a>reading, writing and arithmetic</a>] <a>Literacy and numeracy</a> are skills no one can <a>afford to be without</a>. <a>Curriculum reform</a> is often done for political reasons rather than for good educational ones. [changes to what is covered in the <a>national syllabus</a>] Nowadays, <a>lifelong/continuing</a> education is an issue, and creating opportunities for <a>mature students</a> is important. <a>Special needs education</a> is expensive because class sizes need to be small or one-to-one. Children are unhappy at school if there is a lot of <a>bullying</a>. Some <a>headteachers</a> complain that <a>getting to grips with</a> constant new government <a>guidelines</a> on what schools should be doing is a <a>distraction</a> from what they ought to be focusing on.
</p>

<h2>1. Cramming for success: study and academic work</h2>
<h3>Study and exams</h3>
<p>
Before an exam, some students <a>cram for</a> it. Even if you're a <a>genius</a>, you'll have to <a>do some revision</a>. If the exam happens every year, you can revise by looking at <a>past papers</a>. Some things can be <a>memorised</a> or <a>learnt (off) by heart</a>. But <a>rote-learning</a> is not sufficient for most subjects. It is also possible to use <a>mnemonics</a>. However, all things considered, the best idea is to <a>bury yourself in your books</a> and to study <a>intensively</a> until you <a>know the subject inside out</a>.
</p>
<h3>Academic writing</h3>
<p>
<a>composition</a> could be just 50–100 words, often used for school work.
<a>essay</a> longer than a composition, more serious, hundreds or thousands of words.
<a>assignment</a> a long essay, often part of a course, usually thousands of words.
<a>project</a> like an assignment, but <a>emphasis on</a> student's own material and topic.
<a>portfolio</a> a collection of <a>individual pieces of work</a>; may include drawings and other examples of creative work as well as writing.
<a>dissertation</a> a long, <a>research-based</a> work, perhaps 10–15,000 words, for a <a>degree or diploma</a>.
<a>thesis</a> a very long, <a>original</a>, <a>research-based</a> work, perhaps 80–100,000 words, for a higher degree (e.g. PhD).
</p>
<p>
It's a good idea to start with a <a>mind map</a> when preparing an essay. Always write a <a>first draft</a> before <a>writing up</a> the final version. Your essay should be all your own work; <a>plagiarism</a> is a very serious <a>offence</a> in colleges and universities. It is an increasing problem because it is so easy to <a>cut and paste</a> from materials available on the internet, and students have to sign a <a>plagiarism form</a> to say that the work they are <a>handing in</a> is all their own and that they <a>acknowledge</a> any sources they have used. There is usually a <a>deadline</a>. After the essay is <a>submitted</a>, it will be <a>assessed</a> and usually you can get <a>feedback</a>.
</p>
<h3>Aspects of higher academic study</h3>
<p>
University academics <a>carry out research</a> and are expected to read <a>academic journals</a>, which publish <a>papers/articles</a> on specialised subjects. If a library does not have a copy of a book or journal, you may be able to <a>access it online</a> or you can usually get it through <a>an inter-library loan</a>. <a>Open educational resources</a> are particularly convenient for many students. Academic study can be very <a>demanding</a>, and some students <a>drop out</a>, but <a>the majority</a> survive till <a>finals</a> and become <a>well-qualified</a> members of their future professions.
